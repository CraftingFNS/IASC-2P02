      <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
      <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

      <p>There is a giant shadow that takes the appearance of a giant eye staring intently at us, watching our every movement. The eye is unchanging, never moving, and never blinking. “Is it even human?” The eye is giving us a dead stare that makes me too afraid to move. “Is it alive?” It must be… it has to be… right? It gazes upon us too intently for it to be dead. <span class="clickable" id="first-change">The shadow starts to shrink and expand. </span> Looking as if the eye is blinking, I start to worry more. This is the first time it has moved since I can remember. What does this mean? “Is this being unhappy?” “Why is this happening?” “Why now?” I asked these questions to myself over and over again trying to make sense of the situation. <span class="clickable" id="second-change">The encapsulated shadow begins to move side to side. </span> It’s looking at everyone here. What’s going to happen next?? Is someone going to be selected by the eye? What happens if someone gets chosen? What if that person is me!?!? I don’t want to be chosen. I don’t want to be seen. I just want to live in peace, not having my every move tracked by this… thing!</p>

      <p>Flatness is the inability to comprehend what is happening besides what you, as the viewer can see. This means for you, seeing is the absolute truth and nothing but the truth. You are unable to think that there is a bigger picture, or another perspective behind what is happening on the cave wall. The people in the cave’s interpretation meet this definition by only using the shadows to come up with their own understanding of what is being seen. You have a couple of shadows that roughly resemble a big eye? It’s a big eye. They aren’t asking any questions of “Is this just a couple of moving shapes” or “Maybe this isn’t an eye, maybe this shape means absolutely nothing”. They only see what that shadow makes and can only think about what that shadow is able to do. No concept of other worldly elements, just what they see is the truth. The worldview of the people in the cave is flat because they have no understanding that there might be more than what one could perceive. Their vision is so narrowed in that they can’t even think about there being any other perspective than what they are able to see.</p>

      <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
      <p><span class="clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>

      <p>Third There seems to be two shapes with one inside the other. One torus and one torus knot inside that seem to be flattening and unflattening. However, the torus knot also seems to be moving from side to side. The light source is casting a shadow of the two shapes on a wall, resembling a shape very similar to an eye that is both blinking due to the constant flattening and unflattening, and looking around because of the sideways movement of the knot. <span class="clickable" id="third-change">The torus knot begins to sway between the gap of the torus. </span> The torus knot dangles around the inside of the torus while the torus is moving softly from side to side. Probably due to the wind making the knot attached to the string move. It now appears as though the eye-looking shadow is moving side to side, and looking up and down from time to time. <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">The shapes begin to bounce up and down, </span>casting a shadow that moves to reach both the top and bottom of the cave wall. It makes the eye-like shadow seem as though it’s looking up and down, as if it’s scanning the wall in order to find something.
      </p>

      <p>The concept of seeing double is to get away from looking at things from a fixed perspective. It means to find a new angle and look at the world rather than to view it from a single viewpoint. The people outside the cave see nothing but a couple moving shapes affected by the elements. The shapes outside with help from a light source can move up and down the cave wall, and wind can cause the shapes to move side to side or rotate. Shapes casting a shadow can have people in the cave interpret something scary. People outside of the cave in this case see two moving shapes in a simple harmless manner, whereas the people inside the cave are fearing a potential floating eye monster. The realms between the people inside the cave and outside the cave are connected in a sense that people outside the cave can still interpret what people inside the cave see from an outside perspective, being able to see the whole picture is just a small part of their world. The people inside the cave are still stuck with their own interpretation on what they can see with their fixed viewpoint where the wall is their entire world.</p>
